## Details:

This release is for those that are willing to help with any issues that mazy arise from fitment and use of this toolhead on the Voron v0.2.



- Changes to the geometry of the cowl removing to unnecessary mounting screws, heatsets 

- Better hotend mount fitting to the cowl

- Moved the heatsets for the extruder mounting to the hotend mounts to provide better resistance (except for the Orbiter v1.5 which remains the same as the v0.1 mount)

- Support for the rear X-carriage tilting screw

- Addition of 2 more 4010 mounting self tapping screws

# Caveat:

This beta has <u>not</u> been fitted to a Voron v0.2 as yet. It <u>has</u> been designed, printed and test mounted to the new X-carriage.
