# Dragon Burner

**Only** the v0.2 (plus Printers for Ants variants) configuration is now supported from this version going forward.

This means that to use this release you will need to do the minimal upgrade from v0.1 to v0.2 of either:

New X Carriage, new X/Y joint tops and sensorless homing

or:

New X Carriage mod with built in microswitch for X.

The toolhead currently stays within the v0.1 width measurements, so there's no loss in X if you don't change the X/Y joint tops.

You can also continue to use the [Dragon Burner v4](https://github.com/chirpy2605/voron/tree/main/V0/Dragon_Burner/Old_Versions/v4).
