## Rapid Burner Slim

This should reclaim 2mm of Y with the following restrictions:

- Requires a 3006/3007 hotend fan

- Space between the mount and the X extruder will be tight, you might have to run the heater cables to the outside left of the toolhead. If so, make sure it does not impede travel to extreme left of X travel

- Made for the Rapido UHF, the Dragon UHF would be a tight squeeze

- Only the Orbiter v1.5 mount STL is included with the shroud without a probe. Other options are available in the CAD for export
