# Contribution Guidelines:

If you have an improvement or modification that you would like to include in this repository, please contact me first (chirpy__ on Discord). If you don't contact me first I will not accept a PR.

## Rules:

- All PRs _must_ be submitted to a mods/ subdirectory within the main projects directory

- Within the mods/ directory, create a subdirectory with your Github name

- Then create a subdirectory within that directory with your mod.

- Each mod _must_ have an STL, a STEP file and a short README.md

- _No_ images, videos or links to any resource are allowed in the subdirectory or in the README.md

- Do not modify _any_ files in the main repository or the PR will be rejected
