# Dragon and Rapid Burner Mounts for Trident and 2.4

**NOTE: All information and STL's in this directory are experimental. This means I cannot guarantee that they won't break something on the printer, including your flex sheet!**

**NOTE: Printed parts are likely to change without notice or mention**



The series of mounts in this section have been designed to allow mounting of any of the Dragon Burner or Rapid Burner toolheads to the Voron Trident and Voron 2.4

The main mount is based on the CW2 and allows you to use any of the probes that mount can use. This mount uses:

- MGN12_X_Carriage.stl (the main mount)

- Probe_Support.stl (provides support for probes inside the main mount)

- Probe_Bracket.stl (allows the probe to be affixed to the main mount through the probe support at the rear)

The Tap directory contains a spacer to be used on the back of the Tap probe. It is based on Tap RC8.

If you are going to use the Dragon Burner on a printer that is using an X cable chain, or a printer using the Tap probe, you may need to use the extruder mounts listed in the Dragon_Burner/Tap_or_Chain/ directory so that they clear the chain or probe. These mounts are extruder specific and replace their equivalents in the Dragon Burner repo.

You will need longer screws to go through these mounts.

I would recommend using the following mod to swap out your X carriage mount so that you do not have to re-tension your belts:

Please provide feedback to me on Discord @chirpy#2605 whether positive or negative while testing these mounts.
