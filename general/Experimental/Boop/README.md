# Boop Mount for Dragon and Rapid Burner Toolheads

This mount is designed to be used with Boop v4 Beta. It is a modification of the stock boop_front.stl so that it will work with the Dragon Burner and Rapid Burner toolheads.

Once printed, remove the two small supports (silver in the images above).

For the angled screw holes that go between this part and the upper sensor part, you must use BHCS (Button Head) screws. This is to prevent contact issues between the screws used and the 4010 fans.

You do **not** lose any additional Y from the stock boop_front part.

**This mod should be considered experimental until I get more feedback from installers.**

Please provide feedback to me on Discord @chirpy#2605 whether positive or negative while testing these mounts.
