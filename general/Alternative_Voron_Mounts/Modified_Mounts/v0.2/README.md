# v0.2 X Carriage Replacement Mount

This release is in BETA, this means parts may change and the CAD will not be release until this moves into the final version.

**NOTE: Do not forget to adjust your nozzle offset or calibrate your probe after adding any of these mounts or you will damage your flex plate**

This mount is designed to be used as a replacement for the stock v0.2 mount to add 2 more mount points for the toolhead to attach to, adding rigidity.

The mount comes in two sections. The top part is the X carriage mount which comes in several variations and the lower part which screws into the top part and the rear of the toolhead ducts.

The lower part replaces the need for the rear brace and requires 2 M3x8mm screws.

The top part comes in 4 variations and requires 2 brass heat inserts at the bottom for the lower part to screw in to:

- MGN7H mount

- MGN7H mount with provision for an X axis switch if not using sensorless homing

- MGN9C mount (you will still need replacement A/B motor mounts from [here](https://github.com/ruiqimao/VoronUsers/tree/v0.2-mgn9c/printer_mods/ruiqimao/V0.2_MGN9C_X))

- MGN9C mount with provision for an X axis switch if not using sensorless homing

For the mounts with provision for a microswitch, there is a replacement bumper which is taller to account for the higher position of the switch [here](STLs/[a]_X_Endstop_Bumper_Tall.stl).
