- Revo Voron

- Bambu Labs X1C (and clones)

# Printing:

- Use Voron spec slicer settings and print in ABS/ASA or better

- Do not use Arachne or similar slicer settings as it may cause print problems

# Parts:

You will need:

- The effector plate

- The effector cage

- The Strain Relief

- Lens (opaque, translucent or any other filament if not using Neopixels)

- Lens_Carrier

# Assembly:

It is _very_ important to assemble the effector in the correct order, otherwise you will end up having to dismantle to achieve certain steps.

## Heat inserts:

Add heat inserts at the following locations:

## Hotend Mount:

Screw the hotend to the hotend mount. With the left fan cable going up through the middle of the cage, slide the hotend into the cage from the rear. Using 4x M3x6mm BHCS screws, attach the hotend mount to the cage on both sides.

## Hotend Fan:

Orientate the 3010 fan such that the cable is to the right of the cage and insert through the gap to the right to feed through the channel alongside the right 4010 fan and then back inside the cage through the slot:

## Hotend Neopixel:

Route the hotend Neopixel wires through the channel and up through the gap in the cage to the right to feed through the channel alongside the right 4010 fan and then back inside the cage through the slot.

## Right Fan:

Insert the right 4010 fan being careful to route the cable through the same slot into the cage being careful to lay the routed wires against the wire channel and not pinch them.

## Left Fan:

Insert the left 4010 fan being careful to route the fan cable though the slot to the front of the cage while pulling the fan cable out as you push the fan in:
